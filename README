TODO: 
a. Commit to swisscom git repo
https://git.swisscom.ch/projects/AIS

Issues:
A. Mobile number is not being returned by the DS API call - it defaults to a hardcoded value

Improvements:
1. The connector only accepts one document - extend for several ones.
2. Customer-specific AIS configuration account
3. Logging: https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-logging-tutorial
4. Polling should be done by the client - the redirect to the /poll location is a bit of a hack actually
