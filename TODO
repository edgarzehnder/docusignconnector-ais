Improvements:
1. The connector only accepts one document - extend for several ones. 
2. User specific AIS configuration account (multi-customer).
3. Improve Logging (INFO and DEBUG modes - log files instead of using the console).
4. Improve Error Handling.
5. The polling should be done by the client, the redirect to /poll bit could be implemented more nicely.
6. Multi-threading (serve multiple simultaneous requests) capabilities of nodejs.
